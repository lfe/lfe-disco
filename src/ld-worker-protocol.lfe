  The payload is a dictionary containing the following information:
  * version   The version of the message protocol the worker is using, as a
              string.
  * pid       The integer pid of the worker.

  The worker should send this so it can be properly killed, (e.g. if thereâ€™s a
  problem with the job). This is currently required due to limitations in the
  Erlang support for external spawned processes.

  The worker should send a WORKER message before it sends any others. Disco
  should respond with an OK if it intends to use the same version."
